# True Tea vs. Herbal Tea

It's important to understand the fundamental difference between true tea and herbal tea:

- **True Tea:** All true teas originate from the leaves of the _Camellia sinensis_ plant. The variations in processing methods give rise to the six major types of true tea: green, black, oolong, white, yellow, and dark.
- **Herbal Tea:** Herbal teas, or tisanes, are infusions made from various parts of plants other than _Camellia sinensis_. This includes flowers, leaves, roots, spices, and fruits. Popular examples include chamomile, peppermint, rooibos, and ginger teas.

# The 6 Major Types of Tea

All six major types of tea come from the _Camellia sinensis_ plant. They differ primarily in how they are processed, which affects their oxidation levels, resulting in diverse flavors and aromas.

1. **Green Tea:** Green tea undergoes minimal processing. The leaves are quickly heated after harvesting to prevent oxidation, preserving their green color and fresh, grassy flavor.
2. **Black Tea:** Black tea is fully oxidized, resulting in its characteristic dark brown leaves and robust, malty flavor.
3. **Oolong Tea:** Oolong tea is partially oxidized, falling between green and black tea. This allows for a wide range of flavors and aromas, from floral and fruity to toasty and nutty.
4. **White Tea:** White tea is the least processed of the true teas. Young buds and leaves are simply withered and dried, resulting in a delicate, subtly sweet flavor and pale golden color.
5. **Yellow Tea:** Yellow tea is a rare type of tea that undergoes a unique "smothering" process after withering, which gives it a slightly mellower and sweeter flavor compared to green tea.
6. **Dark Tea:** Dark tea undergoes a microbial fermentation process, resulting in its dark leaves and earthy, sometimes pungent flavor. It is often aged, with some varieties developing a smooth, chocolatey character over time.

# Green Tea

## Processing: Steaming vs. Pan-Firing

The defining characteristic of green tea lies in its processing, which aims to preserve the fresh green qualities of the leaves. The primary step involves applying heat to the leaves, a process known as "fixing," which halts enzymatic activity and maintains the green color and flavor. There are two main methods for fixing green tea:

- **Steaming:** Predominantly used in Japan, steaming yields green teas with pronounced vegetal, grassy, and distinctly "green" characteristics. This method excels at preserving the fresh, verdant attributes of the tea.
- **Pan-firing:** More common in China, pan-firing imparts unique aroma characteristics to the tea. The application of dry heat introduces toasty, nutty notes, often reminiscent of roasted chestnuts.

The choice of fixing method significantly influences the final tea's appearance, taste, and aroma.

## Shaping and Regional Variations

After fixing, green tea undergoes shaping, a process that further defines its character. Pan-fired green teas, for instance, exhibit five primary shapes: slender, flat blade-like, needle-shaped, pearl-shaped, and a less common corkscrew shape. Each shape contributes to the tea's visual appeal and can subtly influence its brewing characteristics.

Regional variations also play a crucial role in shaping the identity of green tea. For example, within the flat blade-shaped pan-fired green teas, we encounter distinct types like Dragon Well, Da Fong, and Chi Chiang. These variations often reflect not only processing styles but also the unique terroir of the regions where they are produced.

## Dragon Well: A Case Study in Tea Taxonomy

To illustrate the complexity of green tea classification, let's uses Dragon Well, often hailed as the "king of green teas" in China, as a case study. Starting with the broad category of flat blade-shaped pan-fired green teas, we navigate through a multi-layered taxonomy:

1. **Shape:** Flat blade-like
2. **Type:** Dragon Well
3. **Location:** West Lake, a renowned Dragon Well production area
4. **Cultivar:** Specific tea plant varieties like Long Jing 43, Ping Yang Tu Zao, and others, each with unique flavor contributions
5. **Harvest Season:** First flush (early spring) teas are prized for their flavor and quality, followed by second flush, summer, and fall harvests. The price and general quality of the tea drop the later in the year it is harvested:
	- First flush (before April 5th) is the most flavorful and coveted.
	- Second flush (before April 21st)
    - Late spring/early summer harvest
    - Summer harvest
    - Fall harvest
7. **Plucking Style:** The part of the tea plant that is plucked also affects the quality and price of the tea:
    - Special grade: Just the top bud
    - First grade: One bud plus one full leaf
    - Second grade: One bud and two leaves
    - Fourth grade: Further down the stalk
    - Fifth grade: The lowest grade

This intricate classification system highlights the nuanced differences between seemingly similar teas. A first-grade, first flush Ping Yang Tu Zao West Lake Dragon Well will possess distinct qualities compared to a second-grade, summer harvest Long Jing 43 West Lake Dragon Well.

## Notable Green Teas

The video recommends several noteworthy green teas, showcasing the diversity within this category:

# Black tea

Black tea is the most oxidized type of tea, and it makes up about 70-80% of the world's tea production. It is frequently used for ready-to-drink teas (RTD) like Arizona Iced Tea and boba tea.

## A Fundamental Distinction

The first major branch point in the black tea world distinguishes between CTC and whole leaf black teas.

- **CTC (Crushed, Torn, Curled):** This processing method, dominant in mass-produced black teas, involves crushing, tearing, and curling the leaves. This results in a uniform, quick-brewing tea often used in tea bags and ready-to-drink beverages. CTC teas generally have a lower grade and simpler flavor profile.
- **Whole Leaf:** As the name suggests, these teas retain the whole leaf structure, allowing for a more nuanced and complex flavor experience. Whole leaf black teas are prized for their diverse aromas and tastes, ranging from floral and fruity to malty and robust.

## Subtypes

Within whole leaf black teas, a key distinction lies in the leaf variety used:

- **Small Leaf (_Camellia sinensis sinensis_):** Cultivated in cooler climates like Northern and Eastern China, Korea, and Japan, these tea plants are hardy and frost-resistant. Black teas made from small leaf varieties tend to be more delicate, with floral, fruity notes, often reminiscent of stone fruits like apricot and peach.
- **Large Leaf (_Camellia sinensis assamica_):** Thriving in warmer, humid climates closer to the equator, these tea plants are found in India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, and Southern China. Large leaf black teas are known for their bold, rich, and malty flavors, offering a more robust and intense taste experience.

The choice of leaf variety significantly influences the final tea's character, offering a spectrum of flavor profiles to suit diverse preferences.

# Dark tea

Dark tea, a unique category defined by its post-production aging process, offers a captivating exploration of time-transformed flavors.

## Aging and Cultivars

Unlike other tea types where processing focuses on halting oxidation, dark tea embraces a secondary oxidation and fermentation process after the initial drying. This extended aging, often lasting years, allows the tea leaves to undergo microbial transformation, resulting in a mellowing of astringency and the development of unique flavors and aromas.

Dark tea processing often involves piling and moistening the leaves, creating an environment conducive to microbial activity. This controlled fermentation, influenced by factors like humidity, temperature, and microbial diversity, contributes to the distinctive character of each dark tea.

Many dark teas utilize local, seed-grown tea cultivars, each with unique genetic makeup and flavor contributions. This diversity, combined with the transformative power of aging, results in a vast array of dark tea expressions. The aging process itself is influenced by various factors, including storage conditions, humidity, and microbial activity.

## Regional Variations

Dark tea production spans various regions in China, each with its own unique approach to aging and processing, resulting in a diverse array of flavors.

- **Yunnan:** Home to the renowned Pu-erh tea, Yunnan boasts a long history of dark tea production. Pu-erh, often pressed into cakes or bricks, undergoes a complex aging process that can last decades, yielding earthy, woody, and sometimes sweet notes.
- **Hunan:** This region produces dark teas like Fu Zhuan and Qian Liang, known for their unique flavor profiles.

# Yellow tea

Yellow tea, often overlooked and misunderstood, holds a unique position in the world of tea.

## Classification

Yellow tea occupies a fascinating middle ground between green tea and dark tea. While it shares similarities with green tea in its initial processing, it undergoes an additional step known as "men huang" or "smothering." This involves wrapping and gently heating the tea leaves, allowing for a slight yellowing and mellowing of the flavor.

This unique step imparts a distinctive character to yellow tea, differentiating it from both green and dark teas. It retains some of the fresh, vegetal notes of green tea while exhibiting a smoother, less astringent profile.

## Processing

The defining characteristic of yellow tea lies in the "men huang" process. After the initial fixing (either steaming or pan-firing), the leaves are wrapped in cloth or paper and gently heated. This creates a humid environment that encourages a slight fermentation and oxidation, resulting in the characteristic yellowing of the leaves.

The smothering process also contributes to the mellowing of the flavor, reducing astringency and imparting a unique smoothness to the tea. This delicate balance of freshness and mellowness sets yellow tea apart from other tea types.

## Plucking Styles

Similar to white tea, yellow tea is also classified based on plucking styles, reflecting the different parts of the tea plant used:

- **Huang Ya Cha:** Made exclusively from buds, similar to Silver Needles in white tea.
- **Huang Xiao Cha:** Made from buds and one to two leaves, akin to Bai Mu Dan in white tea.
- **Huang Da Cha:** Made primarily from leaves, resembling Shou Mei in white tea.

## Notable Yellow Teas
