#  Xinyi shopping district (day/half-day trip, weekday)

It's best to start this trip by going to Taipei's 101 observatory deck early in the morning for two reasons: to get there before the crowds (especially on the weekend) and because visibility tends to be best in the morning and evening.

2. Gift and other shops in the Taipei 101 mall area
3. Grab lunch and walk around the shopping district, enjoying the facilities
4. Walk up the Elephant mountain trail around 4 p.m. to have a snack up the hill with squirrels and catch the sunset (~5:30)

> [!info] $^1$Taipei to Keelung buses
> Although taking a train is always a nice experience, it is more efficient to enjoy the convenience of simply taking a bus from Taipei to Keelung as there is quite many and are probably accessible from various parts of Taipei.

> [!warning] $^2$Heping to Keelung buses
> The bus stops around Zhengbin are super awkward as much as the routes themselves and I'd managed to get confused by them both times I went there, to the point of aimlessly waiting for a bus towards the Keelung centre. Watch out for that as even the most trusty of public transport companions such as *Bus+* can let you down with their real-time infromation service.
